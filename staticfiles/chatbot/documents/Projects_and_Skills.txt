Project Descriptions: Projects Done by Veera Deepesh Gondimalla 

1. Conversational Chatbot for PDFs
   Developed a sophisticated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to interact with and extract information from PDF documents. This project leverages LangChain and Chroma to enable querying of PDF content, employing the Gemini pro model for advanced language understanding. The application features a conversational interface where users can interact with the chatbot to ask questions about the document. Additional functionalities include a read-aloud feature for enhancing accessibility. Chroma DB is utilized for storing and managing vectorized document data, ensuring efficient and accurate retrieval of information. Technologies used: Python, LangChain, Chroma, Streamlit.

2. Presentation Video Analysis using CV
   Created an AI-powered tool to analyze presentation videos, focusing on evaluating and scoring five distinct personality traits of the presenter. This project involved developing a 3-D Conv-LSTM model, which is adept at processing and analyzing spatiotemporal patterns within video data. The model achieved an impressive RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) of 0.05 on the test set, reflecting high accuracy in personality trait assessment. The solution integrates various computer vision techniques to provide insightful feedback on presentation skills. Tools and techniques employed include Computer Vision, OpenCV for video processing, PyTorch for model development, and pydub for audio handling.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis - Zomato Data
   Conducted an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset from Zomato, focusing on dining and delivery trends. This project involved comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing to prepare the dataset for analysis. Key insights were gained through data visualization and statistical analysis using Python libraries. The analysis aimed to uncover patterns in restaurant reviews, delivery times, and customer preferences. Tools used include NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation, Seaborn and Matplotlib for visualizations, and regular expressions (re) for text data processing. This project demonstrated skills in data wrangling and exploratory data analysis to derive actionable business insights.
